# Code of Practice

## Introduction

This Code of Practice provides practical guidelines for implementing the Crisis Unleashed Logo System in accordance with our ethical principles, technical standards, and best practices. It serves as a companion to our Code of Ethics, translating ethical principles into concrete practices.

## Design Practices

### Visual Design

1. **Maintain Brand Integrity**
   - Follow the grid system and proportions defined in the design specifications
   - Use only approved color values from the design tokens
   - Preserve the essential characteristics that make the logo recognizable

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Implement all logos to be responsive across device sizes
   - Use appropriate logo variants for different contexts and sizes
   - Test designs across a range of viewport dimensions

3. **Accessibility in Design**
   - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Provide alternative text for all logo images
   - Test designs with color blindness simulators
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Consider cultural implications of visual elements
   - Avoid symbols that may have negative connotations in different cultures
   - Seek diverse perspectives during the design review process

## Technical Practices

### Implementation

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize SVG files to remove unnecessary elements and attributes
   - Implement appropriate loading strategies (lazy loading where appropriate)
   - Minimize animation impact on performance
   - Test performance on low-end devices

2. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Implement proper ARIA attributes where needed
   - Ensure keyboard navigability for interactive logos
   - Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Provide appropriate fallbacks for unsupported features
   - Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript when possible

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow the project's coding standards and conventions
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Include comprehensive tests for all components

## Documentation Practices

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Document all components, props, and configuration options
   - Provide clear usage examples for different scenarios
   - Include accessibility considerations in documentation
   - Keep documentation in sync with code changes

2. **Clarity and Usability**
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Provide visual examples alongside code
   - Structure documentation logically
   - Consider the needs of users with different experience levels

3. **Internationalization**
   - Consider translation needs for documentation
   - Use inclusive language that translates well
   - Provide region-specific guidance where relevant

## Community Practices

1. **Inclusive Communication**
   - Use inclusive, respectful language in all communications
   - Be welcoming to newcomers and people of all backgrounds
   - Consider different communication styles and preferences
   - Provide multiple channels for engagement

2. **Feedback and Iteration**
   - Actively seek feedback from diverse users
   - Respond constructively to criticism
   - Iterate based on community input
   - Acknowledge contributions appropriately

3. **Mentorship and Support**
   - Provide resources for those learning to use the system
   - Offer mentorship opportunities for new contributors
   - Create a supportive environment for questions and learning
   - Share knowledge generously
