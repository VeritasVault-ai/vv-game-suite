- Creating features that could enable discrimination
- Ignoring feedback from underrepresented groups

### 6. Professional Responsibility

**We commit to:**
- Maintaining high standards of quality and craftsmanship
- Addressing security vulnerabilities promptly
- Providing proper attribution for code and design elements
