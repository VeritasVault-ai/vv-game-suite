## Monica AI Assistant Authentication

This repository is configured to use Monica, GitHub's AI assistant. To set up authentication:

1. When your Codespace launches, the setup script will prompt you to authenticate with GitHub
2. Follow the authentication instructions in the terminal
3. Once authenticated, Monica will be available in your Codespace

If you encounter authentication issues:
- Run `./.devcontainer/scripts/setup-monica-auth.sh` in your terminal
- Ensure your GitHub account has the necessary permissions for this repository
- Check that the Monica extension is installed in VS Code

## Commit Guidelines

- ‚ú® `feat`: A new feature
- üêõ `fix`: A bug fix
- üìö `docs`: Documentation changes
- üíé `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- ‚ö° `perf`: Performance improvements
- ‚úÖ `test`: Adding or updating tests
- üîß `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `‚ú® feat(breakout): add multi-ball power-up system`

## Monorepo Structure

This is a Turborepo-based monorepo containing multiple games:
- `apps/breakout-game`: Phaser-based breakout game with physics
- `apps/crisis-unleashed`: Card-based game built with Next.js
- `packages/*`: Shared libraries used across games

When making changes, consider if functionality could be shared in a package.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices for UI components
- Maintain separation between game logic and UI
- Use the bridge pattern (like `PowerUpReactBridge.ts`) for Phaser-React communication
- Document complex game mechanics with clear comments

## Game Architecture

The breakout games follow a component-based architecture with:
- Managers for different game systems (Paddle, Ball, PowerUp, etc.)
- Factories for creating game objects
- Controllers for handling input and behavior
- Bridges for connecting Phaser game objects to React UI
